## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `msvcrt` (for Windows users)

### Installation and Running

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash

    cd Points
    ```

2. **Start the game**:

## Gameplay

The game is a text-based dungeon crawler in which the player encounters enemies that must be defeated to progress deeper into the dungeon and gain experience.

**Goal:**  
- Go as deep as possible into the dungeon.  
- Defeat enemies and bosses to gain experience.  
- Level up and improve your abilities.  
- Avoid failure, or restart if needed.

## Controls

- **[W]**: Move forward into the dungeon.  
- **[S]**: Move back.  
- **[Quit]**: Exit the game.  
- **[J]**: Restart the game after dying.  
- **[N]**: Quit the game after dying.  
- **Attack**: Press the correct attack key from the options (e.g., [Y], [X], [C], etc.).  
- **Dodge**: Use one of the four possible dodge keys ([Q], [E], [A], [D]).

## Game Flow

1. **Dungeon Depth and Enemies**:  
   You start at floor 0 of the dungeon. Each level features a random enemy or a boss encounter.

2. **Fighting Enemies**:  
   When an enemy appears, press the correct attack key to defeat them. If you fail, you die and must choose whether to try again.

3. **Boss Fights**:  
   At the end of a dungeon depth, you face a boss. You must press the right attack keys and dodge correctly to survive.

4. **Level-Up**:  
   Collect enough experience points to level up and gain more strength to reach deeper floors.

5. **Death and Restart**:  
   If you die, you can restart or quit the game. There is also a cheat code, but thatâ€™s a secret. :3
